This is important when optimising as it allows you to find which parts of your code contribute to the demand you want to reduce and then target your optimisation efforts there.\n","\n","For instance, if ```function_1``` takes 99% of the runtime of your code and ```function2``` takes the rest, there is no point in optimising ```function2``` as even reducing the runtime to zero for that function would not produce a noticeable impact on the runtime of the code as a whole. Instead, optimising ```function1``` should be the priority.\n","\n","For this reason, when optimising a code, the first step is to profile it. This means the time you spend optimising your code will have most impact."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kFnTlggDMezd"},"source":["## Profiling Effectively\n","\n","### Profiling Runs\n","\n","In many cases, when profiling and optimising a large and complex code, it may not be practical to perform full-scale executions of the code. This may be because, for example, the code is designed to run on HPC resources but you're profiling on your desktop. You may need to profile a simplified or scaled-down problem.\n","\n","In addition, it may be that a code may be used in a number of different ways, such as performing many different kinds of simulation or analysing many different kinds of data set. It may be that the code can be run with a multitude of different options that will use different parts of the code. It may be that you need to develop a suite of cases to profile to get a measure of how the code performs in different scenarios.\n","\n","### Length of Profiling Runs\n","\n","If you profile the same bit of code twice, you may get noticeably different execution times for a number of reasons. The shorter the profiling run, the larger the fractional difference between runs is likely to be. This means that a code needs to run for at least a few seconds for profiling to produce meaningful results.\n","\n","However, running the code for a long time is not a good solution either. When optimising a code, you will typically want to profile it after each attempt to improve it, to see if the changes you made had the desired effect. This means you will want to profile the code many times. If each profiling run takes a long time, this will slow down your development cycle.\n","\n","As a result, it's often desirable to have a profiling run that is as short as possible while still producing meaningful results. Often, between 10s and 1 minute is a reasonable compromise, although this may vary depending on the code.\n","\n","### Profiling Effective - Takeaway\n","\n","There isn't a simple answer to ensure you get an effective profile of your code as it may be very problem-specific. You should try to think about what your code is doing and what you want to profile carefully and develop a strategy. Then repeat the profiling a few times to ensure the results remain the same."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Profiling Tools\n","\n","There are a number of different profiling tools available for use in Python. In this notebook, we will look at a sample of them - favouring ones which are simple to implement in a Jupyter Notebook. However, this list is far from exhaustive.\n","\n","The examples in this section relate to running this notebook in Colab. To run this notebook in Anaconda locally a different approach may be required in some cases. Many of the commands are also available from the command line when profiling a ```.py``` file. Again, a different approach will be required in this usage case."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Run-time Profiling\n","\n","Profiling the run-time of the code is probably one of the most important parts of profiling. In many cases, the amount of time the code takes to run is the most limiting factor when deciding if a particular simulation can be carried out on the available computational resources in a reasonable amount of time. There are several useful bits of useful information we can gather.\n","\n","### Timing Code\n","\n","We can manually time code using the ```time``` module. One simple way to use this module is to use the ```time.time()``` function to get the current time at the start and end of the code you want to time. This value is returned as a ```float``` representing the number of seconds since the start of the Unix epoch, which began on 1 January 1970. ```time``` is part of the standard library, so no installation is required."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import time\n","\n","# Get the time at the start of the run\n","start_time = time.time()\n","\n","# This is the code we want to time\n","total = 0\n","for i in range(1000000):\n","    total = total + i\n","print(total)\n","\n","# Get the time at the end of the run\n","end_time = time.time()\n","\n","# Calculate the total time of the run\n","total_time = end_time - start_time\n","print(total_time)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The ```time``` module is very limited for profiling, however, as it involves modifying the source code manually, which is time-consuming and introduces a risk of accidentally leaving timing code in the final version of the code, or introducing bugs when adding or removing timing code.
