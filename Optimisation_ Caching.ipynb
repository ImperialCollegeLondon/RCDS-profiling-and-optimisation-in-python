If a function is complex, it's possible to save a significant amount of time by noting a function has been called before and returning the value that was called then without performing the body of the function.

This means if we could cache the results of the function with those 32 values of ```n``` we could eliminate the bodies of most of the functions and thus most of the function calls and most of the time spent.\n","\n","It's possible to tell Python to cache the results of calls to a function automatically.

In this case, the ```lru_cache``` decorator causes the results of the functions for the last ```maxsize``` unique combinations of arguments provided. When one of the stored combinations of arguments is used to call the function, the cached value is returned instead of calling the function in its entirety.\n","\n","In this case, the body of most function is bypassed in almost every case and, as almost all function calls are in the bodies of function, most function calls are also eliminated. This means the number of function calls is reduced from over 7,000,000 to just 33 and the run-time is also decreased from over a second to almost nothing.\n","\n","This example happens to be a case where this tactic is particularly effective as we can guarantee that there will only be a small number of values passed as an argument and the number of function calls was initially very high.\n","\n","## Exercise\n","Look at the sample code below.
